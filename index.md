Hi! I am **Andualem Welabo Tulu**, a PhD Candidate at the **University of Trento**, Italy.  

My research focuses on **computer vision, visual-language models, and synthetic-to-real adaptation**, with applications in **industrial innovation and automation**.  

I have experience in **industrial and research internships**, generating and annotating **synthetic datasets using Blender and Unity**, and applying **unsupervised domain adaptation for test-time adaptation**.  

Currently, I am exploring **synthetic-to-real domain adaptation** and advanced techniques in **vision-language models** for industrial and academic applications.
